#  StreamingBanditUI

StreamingBanditUI is an open source software tool written in Javascript (particularly, in [React](https://reactjs.org/)), intended to handle the administration of StreamingBanditUI over the Web or from your Desktop.

##  How to install and use StreamingBanditUI 

To start, first make sure you have installed [StreamingBandit server](https://github.com/Nth-iteration-labs/streamingbandit-ui).

Then just follow these steps.

1. Download and unzip the StreamingBanditUI package [here](https://github.com/Nth-iteration-labs/streamingbandit-ui/releases/download/v1.0/StreamingBanditUI.zip), if you haven't already. 
The StreamingBanditUI package will extract into a folder called StreamingBanditUI in the same directory that you downloaded StreamingBanditUI.zip
2. Upload the all of the files contained in the StreamingBanditUI folder to the desired location on your web server and visit index.html.

OR

2. Run StreamingBandit-ui by clicking on index.html in the StreamingBanditUI directory. This works in most, but not all browsers. Recent versions of Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome should work fine.
3. Now enter the IP or domain together with the port what runs StreamingBandit (default: http://localhost:8080)

That's it! You should now be able to access your StreamingBandit server, and start experimenting!
